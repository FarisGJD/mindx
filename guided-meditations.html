        <p>Mindfulness is the practice of maintaining a moment-by-moment awareness of one’s thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations and surrounding environment without judgement. It is a state that is cultivated through meditation and other exercises, empowering the user to live in the present. 

            Here at MINDX we use the philosophies that underpin mindfulness as a form of cognitive behavioural therapy to treat various mental and physical health conditions. We believe that mindfulness is a life skill everyone should possess, as the present moment is the only time over which we have dominion.

                At the core of formal meditation and something that we do instinctively, this short mindfulness exercise focuses on bringing awareness to the process of breathing. Watching our breath allows us to come into the present moment and practice the art of being aware.

                One of the most accessible exercises, body scan meditation involves mindfully bringing attention to our bodies. We mentally scan from head to toe bringing greater awareness to bodily sensations. This helps us feel more connected to our physical self’s, ganging greater insights into potential causes of unwanted feelings.

                Healthy sleep is contingent on quality of rest rather than quantity of hours. The minds propensity of getting occupied on thoughts is arguably strongest at bedtime. Sleep meditations are specific guided experiences that offer a natural sleep aid, allowing us to relinquish the day.

                Morning meditations are used to set the intentions for the day, anchoring us at times of uncertainty. They give us the best opportunity to be fully aware, awake and alive before doing anything. This helps in creating a regular daily routine cultivating a clam, mindful and productive day.

            <p class="paragraph-box">
                The problem with anxiety is that it inhibits our ability for rational thought while it, itself begins to spiral out of control. From a meditation or mindfulness point of view, there are a few options to help. By focusing our concentration, bringing ourselves back to the present moment over and over again we can address the root and relieve the problem whether positive or negative.

            <p class="paragraph-box">
                Depression is a state that weighs us down, narrowing our sense of hope and perspective. Nothing and no one seem to matter which leads to demotivation, isolation and fear. Guided meditations for depression can offer a life line to grapple onto in such dire times. It is not about getting rid of the actual emotion or feeling but rather changing how we engage with depression. It teaches us not to attach such weight or importance to the thoughts that fuel our issues, creating necessary space for us to shift perspective.

            <p class="paragraph-box">
                Life can be stressful causing a sense of unease, triggering our flight-or-fight response. In some cases of extreme danger this physical response is helpful. However, a prolonged state of such worry can cause various mental and physical strains on our bodies. This specific mindful meditation affects the body in exactly the opposite way by triggering the body’s relaxation response.

                By combining meditation and mindfulness this exercise is a form of mental training that teaches us to slow down racing thoughts, let go of negativity and calm both our minds and bodies.
