# Introduction

Mental disorder is the leading cause of morbidity worldwide making it an accrescent field of interest within the medical and public spheres. Recognition of an individual’s psychological state as homogeneously significant to their physical is paramount to their overall wellbeing. This is especially true in the current climate. The impact of the Corona Virus has exponentially increased rates of mental health issues worldwide limiting the accessibility of medical services. Barriers in delivering traditional therapies have led individuals towards the pursuit of holistic solutions for their ailments such as meditation.

Studies show that as lockdown eases world over the demand for simple everyday meditative exercises is on the rise. MIND**X** or MINDX*ercise* is an online platform providing simple body/mind self-improvement techniques to inquisitive and novice meditators alike. Its ethos is based around the teachings of mindfulness ~ to live in the present. Its mission is to improve the overall wellbeing of an individual through visual and voiceover guided meditations. 

MIND**X** uses the philosophies underpinning mindfulness as a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) which is a studied, proven and effective treatment for mental health illnesses. By design MIND**X** increases the accessibility of therapies to larger more diverse audiences when compared to clinical settings. It is unique as it focuses on mindfulness coupled with CBT to create Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) which is unheard of in the market place.

**Trade-off Equation: Importance VS Viability/Feasability**

A trade-off analysis was conducted to rank opportunities based on user needs and business objectivise. Projections are scored in terms of their importance versus their viability/feasibility. The scatter graph shows that 4 out of 5 possibilities can and should be implemented. Accessibility is an issue as MIND**X** is currently web based. It is industry standard for organisations to be both web and app-based meaning MIND**X** needs to be as responsive on different devices as possible.

MIND**X**'s highest priority is to teach users body/mind self-improvement techniques, therefore simple and intuitive access to said techniques is of upmost importance. A hierarchical tree structure is used to organise the website as it reduces complexity, creating a linear narrative.
