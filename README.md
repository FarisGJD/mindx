# Introduction

Mental disorder is the leading cause of morbidity worldwide making it an accrescent field of interest within the medical and public spheres. Recognition of an individual’s psychological state as homogeneously significant to their physical is paramount to their overall wellbeing. This is especially true in the current climate. The impact of the Corona Virus has exponentially increased rates of mental health issues worldwide limiting the accessibility of medical services. Barriers in delivering traditional therapies have led individuals towards the pursuit of holistic solutions for their ailments such as meditation.

 MIND**X** or MINDX*ercise* is an online platform providing simple body/mind self-improvement techniques to inquisitive and novice meditators alike. Its ethos is based around the teachings of mindfulness ~ to live in the present. Its mission is to improve the overall wellbeing of an individual through visual and voiceover guided meditations. Studies show that as lockdown eases world over the demand for simple everyday meditative exercises is on the rise.

MIND**X** uses the philosophies underpinning mindfulness as a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) which is a studied, proven and effective treatment for mental health illnesses. By design MIND**X** increases the accessibility of therapies to larger more diverse audiences when compared to clinical settings. It is unique as it focuses on mindfulness coupled with CBT to create Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) which is unheard of in the market place.

# Development Planes 
## Strategy
The overarching strategy behind MIND**X** is to teach users the fundamental principles of mindfulness as a form of CBT. This is in a bid to improve their overall wellbeing and as a result develop and increase a client base for future releases. 

MIND**X** will focus on the following user attributes acquired from various cross-sectional clinical studies regarding meditative app usage: 

**Demographics**
-	Ages 18 – 65
-	All genders (mainly females)
-	All ethnicities and religions 
-	Suffering with a mental illness mainly: anxiety, depression, stress & sleep disorders 
-	Suffering with physical health issues mainly: high blood pressure, chronic pain, cancer & diabetes 
-	Tech literate and illiterate 

**Psychographics** 
-	Active interest in meditation 
-	Novice meditators
-	Eager to learn new things 
-	Health conscious 
-	Fitness lovers 
-	Looking for lifestyle changes
-	Avoidance coping 

The website *needs* to enable the **User** to: 
-	Find information regarding mindfulness & meditation 
-	Correlate mindfulness as a form of CBT 
-	Easily access video/voice over content 
-	Create an account

The website *needs* to enable the **Client** to: 
-	Develop an online presence by creating a custom website. 
-	Cultivate and increase client base through unique offerings.
-	Showcase a variety of guided meditations.
-	Encourage users to create an online account. 
-	Have a high level of accessibility. 

**Trade-off Equation: Importance VS Viability/Feasibility**

A trade-off analysis was conducted to rank opportunities based on user needs and business objectivise. Projections are scored in terms of their importance versus their viability/feasibility. The scatter graph shows that 4 out of 5 possibilities can and should be implemented. Accessibility is an issue as MIND**X** is currently web based. It is industry standard for organisations to be both web and app-based meaning MIND**X** needs to be as responsive on different devices as possible.

# Structure
MIND**X**'s highest priority is to teach users body/mind self-improvement techniques, therefore simple and intuitive access to said techniques is of upmost importance. A hierarchical tree structure is used to organise the website as it reduces complexity, creating a linear narrative. Even though tree structures pose issues in regards to mobile devices, methods have been implemented to remedy this such as a high level of responsiveness.

![Hierarchical Tree Structure](assets/readme-assets/site-structure.png)

Even though the site is currently a minimal viable product meaning a modest amount of information, three separate pages are needed for future manageability. MINDX has specific content (helpful articles, games & downloadable items) it needs to add to each section. Furthermore this design deliberately follows the teachings of mindfulness ~ living in the present as to make each page unique and the primary focus for the user. 


index.html:
-	Header – introduces MIND**X** official logo and familiarises the user with the site’s navigational planes, leveraging their prior experience. 
-	Background Image & Ethos – reinforces the identity of the website and creates and eye-catching landing page.  
-	Footer – provides social media and contact details so that when the user concludes they can get in contact.  

guided-meditation.html:
-	Header – keeps the site consistent, offers another call to action & provides easy navigation (e.g., sticky header).  
-	Intro To MINDX & MBCT – creates brand awareness and begins to address user stories, as well as introduces the key concepts of the brand (USP). 
-	Mindfulness Meditations 1 – 4 – most important and visited part of the website, lessons build on each other in terms of relevance and difficulty making the next exercise easier. 
-	Footer – again keeps the site consistent creating familiarity. 

sign-up.html:
-	Header – creates uniformity and establishes conventions. 
-	Call To Action Signup Form – allows users to create an account with MINDX in a bid to develop a core client base.  
-	Interactive Image – creates interest around the page whilst strengthening the brand. 
-	Footer – gives another opportunity to get in touch and explore.

# Skeleton 
Wireframes were created using Balsamic to determine the basic navigation and interface design of the site. It is important to give form to function meaning the meditative lessons need to speak for themselves. A minimalistic design in terms of navigation and content is employed accompanied by engaging images and key text. Market leading competitors such as Headspace, Calm & Brainfm have adopted similar methodologies so it is important to leverage user’s prior experience. The site will utilise progressive disclosure which is especially important when learning meditation as this is deemed the best way an individual can absorb and turn meditation into a habit.

# Surface

## Colour Scheme  
The colour story behind MIN**X** was inspired from the background image used on the Home page; a peach (#f1c2b0) background leads with accents of “brain pink” (#f7756f) to complement. White (#ffffff) was later injected to provide a dynamic colour scheme. Finally light blue (#468C98) was introduced on the Sign-Up page as a kind of tease for future releases and colour story. 
![Color Scheme](assets/readme-assets/mindx-color-scheme.png)

## Typography
Three different fonts are used throughout the website for different connotations, creating a strong font design. The two main pairings are Raleway and Roboto which are both sans-serif fonts that complement each other. Both have an extensive font family meaning they have a variety of thin and bold choices giving a good contrast. For example, Raleway (900 weight) is used for the logo, ethos and main headings, capturing the user’s attention while Roboto (300 weight) is used for the body text as the letter form works well together. Oswald (500 weight) another sans-serif font is used solely for the navigation items as to make the stand out from the rest of the information.

## Imagery
The images used in MIND**X** are connected to the field on mindfulness and the wider topics surrounding it. The landing page uses a high-fidelity image of a brain meant to immediately capture the user’s attention. Ideally the remaining images would have been the same quality but due to resource constraints icons were used. This said text-shadows were used to tie the image together as to be cohesive. 

## Features
**Header**
 -	Logo – introduces MIND**X** identity and initiates the user’s discovery phase where they begin to ask questions about the brand.
-	Navigation Links – facilitates the user’s exploration of the site through three clearly defined sections. 
-	Call To Action – gives users visual que to sign up to MIND**X** increasing client base and informing them about future releases.  

![Header](assets/readme-assets/header.png)

**Footer**
-	Social Media Links – allows users to view MIND**X** as a whole outside of the context of the web app. 
-	Contact Information – permits users to contact MIND**X** for any questions relating to the exercises or general information. 
-	Copyright – protects MINDX intellectual property. 

![Footer](assets/readme-assets/footer.png)

**index.html** 
-	Background Image – an impactful and eye-catching image welcoming the user to the site and teasing what is ahead.
-	Ethos – text accompanying the background image, reinforcing what MIND**X** is about and what the user should expect moving forward. 

![Home Page](assets/readme-assets/home-page.png)

**guided-meditations.html**
•	Guided Meditation Introduction – defines the founding concepts that make MIND**X** unique such as mindfulness, MBCT and guided meditations that work their way up in difficulty and applicability. 

![Intro MBCT](assets/readme-assets/intro-to-mbct.png)

•	Exercises – ten guided exercises that are comprised of a title, introductory paragraph, video/audio exercise and an image. This type of progressive disclosure is used to give a brief overview of what each exercise is before engaging with the actual instructional meditation. This allows the user to access their most relevant exercises for their specific needs.

# Bugs & Issues
-	The background image had extremely slow loading times due to two determined factors. The first being the file size which was compressed using online tools. The second was the use of absolute file paths which had incompatibility issues with GitHub Pages so a relative path was used instead. 
-	 The icons used had a predefined maximum font size (48px) which was smaller than preferred so the !important rule was called to overcome this. 
-	Text shadow of white were used on each letter of the logo and ethos which proved to be problematic when the font reaches a certain size so it was removed. 
-	Guided meditations file size was too large for GitPod to host, so Git Large File Storage was used to do so.
