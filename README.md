# Introduction

Mental disorder is the leading cause of morbidity worldwide making it an accrescent field of interest within the medical and public spheres. Recognition of an individual’s psychological state as homogeneously significant to their physical is paramount to their overall wellbeing. This is especially true in the current climate. The impact of the Corona Virus has exponentially increased rates of mental health issues worldwide limiting the accessibility of medical services. Barriers in delivering traditional therapies have led individuals towards the pursuit of holistic solutions for their ailments such as meditation.

 MIND**X** or MINDX*ercise* is an online platform providing simple body/mind self-improvement techniques to inquisitive and novice meditators alike. Its ethos is based around the teachings of mindfulness ~ to live in the present. Its mission is to improve the overall wellbeing of an individual through visual and voiceover guided meditations. Studies show that as lockdown eases world over the demand for simple everyday meditative exercises is on the rise.

MIND**X** uses the philosophies underpinning mindfulness as a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) which is a studied, proven and effective treatment for mental health illnesses. By design MIND**X** increases the accessibility of therapies to larger more diverse audiences when compared to clinical settings. It is unique as it focuses on mindfulness coupled with CBT to create Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) which is unheard of in the market place.

# Development Planes 
## Strategy
The overarching strategy behind MIND**X** is to teach users the fundamental principles of mindfulness as a form of CBT. This is in a bid to improve their overall wellbeing and as a result develop and increase a client base for future releases. 

MIND**X** will focus on the following user attributes acquired from various cross-sectional clinical studies regarding meditative app usage:

-	Ages 18 – 65c
-	All genders (mainly females)
-	All ethnicities and religions 
-	Suffering with a mental illness mainly: anxiety, depression, stress & sleep disorders 
-	Suffering with physical health issues mainly: high blood pressure, chronic pain, cancer & diabetes 
-	Tech literate and illiterate 

**Psychographics** 
-	Active interest in meditation 
-	Novice meditators
-	Eager to learn new things 
-	Health conscious 
-	Fitness lovers 
-	Looking for lifestyle changes
-	Avoidance coping 

The website *needs* to enable the **User** to: 
-	Find information regarding mindfulness & meditation 
-	Correlate mindfulness as a form of CBT 
-	Easily access video/voice over content 
-	Create an account

The website *needs* to enable the **Client** to: 
-	Develop an online presence by creating a custom website. 
-	Cultivate and increase client base through unique offerings.
-	Showcase a variety of guided meditations.
-	Encourage users to create an online account. 
-	Have a high level of accessibility. 

**Trade-off Equation: Importance VS Viability/Feasibility**

A trade-off analysis was conducted to rank opportunities based on user needs and business objectivise. Projections are scored in terms of their importance versus their viability/feasibility. The scatter graph shows that 4 out of 5 possibilities can and should be implemented. Accessibility is an issue as MIND**X** is currently web based. It is industry standard for organisations to be both web and app-based meaning MIND**X** needs to be as responsive on different devices as possible.

# Structure
MIND**X**'s highest priority is to teach users body/mind self-improvement techniques, therefore simple and intuitive access to said techniques is of upmost importance. A hierarchical tree structure is used to organise the website as it reduces complexity, creating a linear narrative. Even though tree structures pose issues in regards to mobile devices, methods have been implemented to remedy this such as a high level of responsiveness.

Even though the site is currently a minimal viable product meaning a modest amount of information, three separate pages are needed for future manageability. MINDX has specific content (helpful articles, games & downloadable items) it needs to add to each section. This design deliberately follows the teachings of mindfulness ~ living in the present as to make each page unique and the primary focus of the user. 


index.html:
-	Header – introduces MIND**X** official logo and familiarises the user with the site’s navigational planes, leveraging their prior experience. 
-	Background Image & Ethos – reinforces the identity of the website and creates and eye-catching landing page.  
-	Footer – provides social media and contact details so that when the user concludes they can get in contact.  

guided-meditation.html:
-	Header – keeps the site consistent, offers another call to action & provides easy navigation (e.g., sticky header).  
-	Intro To MINDX & MBCT – creates brand awareness and begins to address user stories, as well as introduces the key concepts of the brand (USP). 
-	Mindfulness Meditations 1 – 4 – most important and visited part of the website, lessons build on each other in terms of relevance and difficulty making the next exercise easier. 
-	Footer – again keeps the site consistent creating familiarity. 

sign-up.html:
-	Header – creates uniformity and establishes conventions. 
-	Call To Action Signup Form – allows users to create an account with MINDX in a bid to develop a core client base.  
-	Animated Image – creates interest around the page whilst strengthening the brand. 
-	Footer – gives another opportunity to get in touch and explore.

# Skeleton 
Wireframes were created using Balsamic to determine the basic navigation and interface design of the site. It is important to give form to function meaning the meditative lessons need to speak for themselves. A minimalistic design in terms of navigation and content is employed accompanied by engaging images and key text. Market leading competitors such as Headspace, Calm & Brainfm have adopted similar methodologies so it is important to leverage user’s prior experience. The site will utilise progressive disclosure which is especially important when learning meditation as this is deemed the best way an individual can absorb and make meditation into a habit.
